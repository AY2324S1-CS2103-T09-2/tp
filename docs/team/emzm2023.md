### Project: CodeContact

CodeContact is a desktop address book solution for Software Engineering companies. The user interacts with it using a
CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `mark-deadline` and `unmark-deadline`
    * What it does: Gives users the ability to mark project deadlines as done or undone.
    * Justification: One basic job of project managers is to manage deadlines, so having a mark and unmark feature
  allows them to update the status of the project and project deadlines accordingly.
    * Highlights: Deadline fields had to be updated to ensure that an index is saved when a deadline for a project is
  created. Further methods also had to be implemented to toggle the `isDone` status of a deadline between `true` and
  `false`. Additional changes to the existing GUI were made to reflect deadline numbers to allow users to mark and
  unmark deadlines according to the index. This involved adding a new column to the table of deadlines that displayed
  deadline indexes.


* **Enhancement to existing features**: `edit-developer`, `edit-client`, `edit-project`
    * What it does: Allows users to edit the fields of existing developers, clients, and projects.
    * Justification: This gives project managers the flexibility and freedom to change and update the details if
  necessary. Aside from keeping contact details accurate, this is also especially important as it allows for the
  reassignment of developers to new projects and the updating of project deadlines after milestones.
    * Highlights: Edits are done according to the object's index in the displayed list in the relevant tab. Making
  edits to objects automatically switches the tab on the GUI to the relevant one. Various code changes to the existing
  `edit` function had to be made to account for the different fields of the object to edit, as well as various
  implemented restrictions on fields that could and could not be changed. The respective Parser and Command classes
  were extended to account for each additional field, and thorough checks were implemented to ensure that users are
  unable to access prefixes that are meant for other objects.


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI project table columns and CSS (Pull requests [\#142]())


* **Other significant code contributions**:
  * Initially implemented edit command with behaviour varying in response to access rights, but undid changes due to
  shift in project direction (Pull request [\#59](), [\#66]())
  * Implemented Project and Project relevant classes (eg. Deadline, Priority, Description) for use by team (Pull
  request [\#73]())
  * Implemented project validation checks used in `add-client`, `add-developer`, `edit-client`, and `edit-developer` to
  ensure assigned projects exist in the address book (Pull request [\#159]())
  * Wrote additional tests for features to increase coverage (Pull request [\#249]())


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=emzm2023&breakdown=true)


* **Project management (team-based tasks contributions)**:
    * Set up project schedule tracking with milestones and issues for `v1.1`
    * Updated Developer Guide with project notes for `v1.1`
    * Add screenshots of UI and managed the collaboration group document for tutorial checks
    * Create and release JAR file for `v1.3`
    * Assign labels and assignees to bug issues in post-PED


* **Documentation Contributions**:
    * User Guide Contributions:
        * Added documentation for the features `edit-developer`, `edit-client`, `edit-project`, `mark-deadline`
        , and `unmark-deadline` (Pull requests [\#104](), [/#151](), [/#163]())
        * Created template format for other team members to follow for their portion of the User Guide (Pull request
      [\#151]())
        * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation for standardisation and fixed bugs across entire UG
      (Pull request [\#252]())
    * Developer Guide Contributions:
        * Added all user stories and several use cases for initial iteration, but undid changes due to shift in project
      direction (Pull request [\#35]())
        * Added implementation details of the features `edit-developer`, `edit-client`, `edit-project`, `mark-deadline`
        , and `unmark-deadline` (Pull request [\#109](), [\#263]())
        * Added instructions for manual testing in Appendix (Pull request [\#263]())
        * Added planned enhancements in Appendix (Pull request [\#263]())


* **Community (Review/mentoring contributions)**:
    * Helped to modify add command parsers with part of my implementation for edit command parsers to ensure more
  thorough and bug-free parsing of user inputs (Pull request [\#127]())
    * Conducted pull request reviews for team members (Pull request [\#238]())
    * Helped to modify and reformat add commands portion on User Guide (Pull request [\#263]())


* **Contributions beyond the project team**:
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the cohort


**Contributions to the Developer Guide (Extracts)**:
### Edit features
#### Implementation
The original edit feature from AB-3 has been extended to account for the editing of projects and specific people - developers
and clients. The edit command will be parsed to return 1 of 3 different commands, depending on the
object to be edited.

The `AddressBookParser` will return the respective parser for the command depending on the user input in accordance to the
respective command words defined in `CliSyntax`. Namely,
* `edit-developer` will return an `EditDeveloperCommandParser` that parses the user input and creates an `EditDeveloperCommand`
* `edit-client` will return an `EditClientCommandParser` that parses the user input and creates an `EditClientCommand`
* `edit-project` will return an `EditProjectCommandParser` that parses the user input and creates an `EditProjectCommand`

Each instance of `EditDeveloperCommand`, `EditClientCommand`, and `EditProjectCommand` objects have 2 private fields:
1. an instance of `Index` containing the index of the target object to edit in the currently displayed list, and
2. an instance of `EditDeveloperDescriptor`, `EditClientDescriptor`, or `EditProjectDescriptor` respectively, which
   contains the edited fields to update the target object with.

Executing the command will replace the existing object in the current `model` with the new object with the edited fields.

Other than extending the commands, parsers, and descriptors to account for `Developer`, `Client`, and `Project` separately,
some changes to the sequence of interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components were also made. When
`EditDeveloperCommand` and `EditClientCommand` is executed with edits made to a `Project` assigned to a `Developer` or
`Client`, it calls `Model#areProjectsValid()` to check whether there is an existing `Project` with that name.

Given below is an example usage scenario where the user edits the projects assigned to a `Developer` using the `edit-developer`
command.

**Step 1.** User launches the application and unlocks the application with the correct password.

**Step 2.** User executes an edit developer command by entering `edit-developer 1 pr/AppleApp` to edit the projects assigned
to the developer at index 1 (one-based indexing) in the currently displayed developer list.

**Step 3.** The developer at index 1 is edited to be assigned to the project `AppleApp` given that there is an existing
project with the name `AppleApp` in the address book.

The sequence diagram below illustrates key interactions taking place in the `Logic` component when the command
`edit-developer 1 pr/AppleApp` is called. A significant modification to take note off is the call to the
`Model#areProjectsValid()` method. This sequence reflects a successful command execution.

![Interactions inside the Logic component for the `edit-developer 1 pr/AppleApp` Command](images/EditDeveloperSequenceDiagram.png)

The `edit-client` and `edit-project` commands are executed similarly, except project validation checks using the
`Model#areProjectsValid()` method are not conducted for the latter.

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Command syntax**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Have separate commands for each `Developer`, `Client`, and `Project`. Executing the command
  automatically switches user to the respective tab.
  * Pros: More specific and straightforward, allowed parameters in command are easier to navigate for users. More flexible
    as do not need to be in respective tab to edit.
  * Cons: More classes to create, user needs to type more.
* Alternative 2: Have one general `edit` command. The edit will be made based on the current tab displayed.
  * Pros: User as can be less specific when typing command.
  * Cons: User needs to ensure that intended tab is open. Allowed parameters are less clearly defined, can lead to
    confusion and mistakes.

### Mark/unmark deadline features
#### Implementation
The mark and unmark deadline features are implemented using a secondary call to the `edit-project` command. As with
the other commands, `mark-deadline` and `unmark-deadline` commands are first parsed to return `MarkDeadlineCommandParser`
and `UnmarkDeadlineCommandParser` respectively. The parses similarly implement the `MarkDeadlineCommandParser#parse()`
and `UnmarkDeadlineCommandParser#parse()` methods which return `MarkDeadlineCommand` and `UnmarkDeadlineCommand` objects
respectively. However, in the execution of `MarkDeadlineCommand` and `UnmarkDeadlineCommand`, a new
`EditProjectCommand` is created and subsequently executed, to get the `CommandResult`.

Consequently, calling `mark-deadline` and `unmark-deadline` on a deadline of project is synonymous to editing the
project to update the `isDone` status of the deadline.

This is facilitated by the following methods:
* `MarkDeadlineCommand#editProjectArgs()`  —  Formats each deadline in a list of String representations into a
  String that will be used as the arguments parsed by an EditProjectCommandParser.
* `Project#markDeadlineStringRep()`  —  Returns a list with each element being the String representation of the
  respective deadline, with the deadline at the given index marked as done.
* `Project#unmarkDeadlineStringRep()`  —  Returns a list with each element being the String representation of the
  respective deadline, with the deadline at the given index marked as undone.

Relevant checks are conducted at the `MarkDeadlineCommand#execute()` and `UnmarkDeadlineCommand#execute()` stages to
ensure the index of the project and the edited deadline passed to the `EditProjectCommandParser` as arguments for the
`EditProjectCommandParser#parse()` as arguments are valid.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions taking place in the `Logic` component when the command
`mark-deadline 2 1` is called. The sequence reflects a successful command execution, assuming that the current state of
the displayed project list has a project with the index `2` with at least `1` deadline.

![SequenceDiagram](images/MarkDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Execution of command**
* Alternative 1: Implement methods in `ModelManager` class that can directly change the `isDone` status of the deadlines
  of a project based on the given project index and deadline index.
  * Pros:
    * More aligned with OOP principles.
    * Mirrors sequence flow of other commands and can be implemented using current code architecture.
  * Cons:
    * Due to container structure of `Project` and `Deadline`, changing the status of deadlines needs to be done
      through projects, so more methods need to be added to achieve this.
    * Given the GUI display of project deadlines in a Javafx TableView, makes it more complicated for changes in
      deadline status to be automatically reflected in the list of projects and deadlines displayed to the user.
* Alternative 2 (current choice): Implement execution by creating an `EditProjectCommandParser` and `EditProjectCommand`
  that will replace the existing project entirely with a new one with the updated deadline being marked/unmarked.
  * Pros:
    * Fewer methods to implement, allows for more reuse.
    * Editing the project with new deadlines will ensure that upon execution of the command, the updated project with
      marked/unmarked deadline is displayed to the user on the app.
  * Cons:
    * Slightly more disorganised interactions within `Logic` component since have to go from parsing a command to
      executing it, then parsing another command again and executing that command.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**

### Validation checks for duplicate fields in edit commands
**Current Behavior:** Two developers can have the same details (eg. address, phone number, email) as long as their name
is not the same. This program behaviour also exists for clients.
<br>
**Enhanced Behavior:** Validation checks should be conducted for email, contact number and address when adding or
editing developers or clients to make sure that no two developers or clients have repeated details since this is
unrealistic.

### Validation checks for unedited fields in edit commands
**Current Behavior:** A developer, client, or project can be edited to have the exact same details as it currently has.
<br>
**Enhanced Behavior:** Validation checks should be conducted which notifies the user when they try to edit an existing
developer, client, or project, to have the exact same details as it currently has. This makes it more user-friendly as
if such an occurrence happens, it is likely that it was a mistake or typo in the command.
