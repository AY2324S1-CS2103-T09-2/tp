## Introduction

Seamlessly integrate contact, client, and project management, simplifying access to coding-related contacts,
facilitating collaboration, and offering command-line efficiency for project managers

CodeContact is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CodeContact can get your contact
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How can this guide help me?

If you are a new user, we hope to first inform you on how you can [get started](#quick-start) using CodeContact.

As you use CodeContact, you may also have questions on how to perform certain actions within the
application. This guide thus contains a comprehensive list of [Features](#features) offered with CodeContact, as well as
explanations on when and how to use them.

Further questions are also answered within a [FAQ](#faq) section below.

### Parameter Information

Within the tables below, you can find out more about the parameters that CodeContact supports. These parameters come in
handy when crafting commands in CodeContact.

Here are some notes about these parameters.

* Each parameter comes with **constraints**. These constraints detail the specific formats of text that
  each parameter accepts as valid user input.
    * Not following these constraints will **result in an error** when entering the command.
      *Nonetheless, CodeContact will not stop working. Rather, a message will be provided to you on
      how to correct your command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</div>

### Lock `lock`

Locks the system by hiding all the information in the tabs on the GUI. It also disables parsing of commands
except `unlock`, `help`, and `delete`

Format: `lock`

When command succeeds, CLI shows:

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: How can I launch CodeContact if the clicking on the JAR file does not work? <br>
**A**: There are two possible methods to launch CodeContact.
<br>

* Method 1: For users familiar with the command prompt

1. Open the command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located using cd [JAR file location]
3. Type java -jar CodeContact.jar and press enter
4. CodeContact should launch
   <br> <br>

* Method 2: For users that wish to create a script to launch Docedex (Recommended)

1. Create a new text file
2. Type the following into the text file:
   `java -jar [JAR file location]/CodeContact.jar`
3. Save the text file as CodeContact.bat (Windows) or CodeContact.sh (MacOS/Linux)
4. Change the admin settings of the script to allow it to run as a program:
    * Windows: Right-click on the script and select Properties. Under General , check
      the box that says Allow this file to run as a program .
    * MacOS/Linux: Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is
      located. Type `chmod +x [script name]` and press enter. ( `chmod +x` changes
      permissions of the script to allow it to be executed.)
5. Double-click on the script to launch CodeContact
6. CodeContact should launch

**Q**: How can I check my java version?<br>

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
